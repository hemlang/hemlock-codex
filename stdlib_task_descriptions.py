"""Descriptions for stdlib-focused SFT tasks.

Keyed by (module, task_name). Each description should describe the *problem*
without naming the stdlib module — the generator decides per-row whether to
append a "Use @stdlib/X" hint or not, so the model learns both:

  (a) when told the module, import and use it correctly
  (b) when given a problem, recognize the right module on its own

Style: Write each description as a bare imperative phrase so it slots into
"Write a Hemlock program to {desc}" and "In Hemlock, {desc}".
Example: "compute the mean of a list" (good), "computes the mean..." (wrong).

Naming convention for .hml files: hemlock/stdlib/<module>/<task>.hml

    #   5. datetime, time          (common to practical tasks)
    #   6. hash, encoding, crypto  (one-liner stdlib exercises)
    #   7. async, atomic, channel  (fixes L4 concurrency misses)
    #   8. fs, path, glob, env     (scripting plumbing)
